# Barrier-deamon
A simple script to create a daemon to enable startup auto-launch of Barrier in Linux.  
It will create a systemctl service for the server or the client. Both can be done if necessary.
I tried to increase the priority level, because I saw there was less lag when using Barrier. But systemctl isn't considering it.
